## diff so clean, even prod approved it

`rizz` is a terminal TUI that gives you GitHub's "Files Changed" experience for your own uncommitted changes. Scroll the diff, check files off as you review them, ship with confidence — no PR required.

Built for the solo dev, the vibe-coder, the one who ships straight to main and still wants to look over 14 AI-generated files before `git push`.

## why tho

You're deep in the zone. Your AI bestie just wrote half a feature. You need to actually *read the diff* before committing. Your options:

- ❌ Open a PR, review yourself, merge, pull main, delete branch. That's **five steps** for solo work.
- ❌ Blast through `git diff` in a dumb pager and hope you don't miss a file.
- ❌ Boot lazygit, get overwhelmed by 47 panels, rage-quit.
- ✅ Run `rizz`. Scroll. Check. Ship.

## install

```bash
go install github.com/Gogoro/rizz@latest
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gogoro/rizz.git
cd rizz
go build
mv rizz /usr/local/bin/   # or wherever your PATH points
```

Requires Go 1.22+.

## try it

A demo script spins up a throwaway git repo with varied, realistic changes (Go, CSS, YAML, Markdown, tests, new files, deleted files) so you can see rizz actually working:

```bash
./demo/setup.sh
cd /tmp/rizz-demo
rizz
```

## usage

```bash
# review your uncommitted changes (default)
rizz

# review staged changes only
rizz --staged

# review your branch vs main (or any ref)
rizz --base main
rizz --base origin/develop
rizz --base v1.2.0

# swap the syntax theme
rizz --theme dracula
rizz --theme list        # print all available themes

# skip the boot animation
rizz --no-splash
```

## features

### two-pane navigation

Sidebar on the left with every changed file. Big diff on the right. Focus flips between them: `enter` to dive into the diff, `esc` to jump back to the file list. Muscle memory stays consistent — `j/k` always means "move" in whichever pane has focus.

### viewed tracking that doesn't lie

Mark files with `v` (or space), track with the 💎 diamond marker. State lives in `.git/rizz-state.json` per repo — no global mess.

Each viewed mark is keyed to a hash of that file's diff content. When the diff changes (you commit, you edit, anything), the mark auto-invalidates. Same behavior as GitHub's "Viewed" checkbox on PRs.

Hit `U` to jump to the next unviewed file.

### syntax highlighting

Powered by [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) — ~200 languages detected by filename. Default theme is `catppuccin-mocha`. Swap with `--theme <name>` or set `theme = "dracula"` in the config file.

### word-level diff

For isolated `-` / `+` line pairs, rizz highlights the exact changed words with a brighter background. Small renames, tweaks, and typos pop immediately.

### line numbers

GitHub-style gutter: old line number on the left, new line number on the right, muted so they don't dominate.

### file filter

Press `/`, start typing, file list narrows in real time to path substring matches. `esc` clears. Handy when 47 files changed and you only want to review the Go ones.

### commit message suggestions

Press `m` for a vibey commit message generator that reads your file types and operations and spits out suggestions in the logo's style (`feat: add rizz`, `fix: remove cringe code`, `style: drip check passed`, etc.).

### help overlay

`?` anywhere — modal popup with every keybinding grouped by mode.

### vim-style commands

Press `:` for a command prompt. `:q`, `:quit`, `:help`, `:a`, `:r` all work. `:w` tells you that rizz doesn't write, it only reviews.

### the easter egg

Type `r-i-z-z` anywhere. You'll see.

### mouse support

Click a file to open it. Scroll wheel navigates the file list in the sidebar and scrolls the diff in the main pane.

### boot splash

A little ⛓ RIZZ ⛓ flex on launch. Press any key to skip, or run with `--no-splash`.

### file type flex

`rizz` drops an emoji next to each file so you can skim what's changing at a glance:

| ext | icon | ext | icon | ext | icon |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `.go` | 🐹 | `.ts` | 🟦 | `.js` | 🟨 |
| `.py` | 🐍 | `.rs` | 🦀 | `.rb` | ♦️ |
| `.css` `.scss` | 🎨 | `.html` | 🌐 | `.md` | 📝 |
| `.json` | 📦 | `.yaml` | 📋 | `.toml` `.ini` | ⚙️ |
| `.sh` `.bash` | 🐚 | `.sql` | 🗄 | `Dockerfile` | 🐳 |
| `Makefile` | 🔨 | `*_test.go` | 🧪 | images | 🖼 |
| `.env` | 🔐 | `.lock` | 🔒 | anything else | 📄 |

## keybindings

Two focus modes: **file list** on the left, **diff view** on the right. `enter` to open, `esc` to return.

**list mode**

| key | action |
|---|---|
| `j` · `k` · `↑` · `↓` | move between files |
| `g` · `G` | first · last file |
| `enter` · `l` · `→` | open diff view |

**diff mode**

| key | action |
|---|---|
| `j` · `k` · `↑` · `↓` | scroll the diff |
| `ctrl+d` · `ctrl+u` · `d` · `u` | half-page down · up |
| `ctrl+f` · `ctrl+b` · `pgdn` · `pgup` | full page down · up |
| `g` · `G` | top · bottom of diff |
| `esc` · `h` · `←` | back to list |

**works in both modes**

| key | action |
|---|---|
| `n` · `tab` | next file |
| `p` · `shift+tab` | previous file |
| `U` | jump to next unviewed |
| `v` · `space` | toggle viewed 💎 |
| `a` | mark all viewed |
| `r` | reset all |
| `/` | filter files (esc clears) |
| `m` | commit message suggestions |
| `:` | vim-style command |
| `?` | help overlay |
| `q` · `ctrl+c` | quit |

Mouse: click a file in the sidebar to open it; scroll wheel navigates the sidebar or scrolls the diff depending on where you hover.

## config file

Optional. Drop a TOML file at `~/.config/rizz/config.toml`:

```toml
# override the syntax theme
theme = "dracula"

# add alternate keys for any action.
# your custom keys work *in addition to* the built-in defaults.
[keybinds]
view-toggle    = "V"
help           = "F1"
next-unviewed  = "x"
commit-msgs    = "M"
```

Run `rizz --theme list` to see all available chroma themes.

## cli flags

| flag | purpose |
|---|---|
| `--base <ref>` | compare current branch vs a ref (uses merge-base) |
| `--staged` | review only staged changes |
| `--theme <name>` | override syntax theme (use `list` to print all) |
| `--no-splash` | skip the boot animation |

## what's NOT here (yet)

- No side-by-side diff (unified only)
- No inline comments or annotations
- No staging, committing, or any git mutation — `rizz` is strictly read-only
- No clipboard yanking of hunks
- No config-based keybind *replacement* — only aliases

If any of these would genuinely make your life better, open an issue.

## status

🚧 **alpha**. Sharp edges, missing features, opinions baked into the defaults. Works on macOS and Linux. Windows? Probably. Report back.
